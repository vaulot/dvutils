# Define PR2 global environment variables ----------------------------

# Note : This is a way to create datasets, but for variables it is really cumbersome.
# So this initialization has been move to the file env.R in the R directory
# This could be used to store larger data sets used for the analysis

# NOT used anymore... This is defined in the init.R files for each application
